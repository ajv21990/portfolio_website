                                reduce congestion as well strengthen a sense of community within Long Beach and the surrounding southern California areas. My role on this project was implementing an interface that allowed users to see the nearest ride options near them.
                                I implemented Google Maps using the React framework to show users the nearest scooter, bike, or car services within their specified distance. I was able to obtain the data about the services
                                from API's provided by the hackathon. I also was tasked with a login and registration page.</p>

                                We placed third on this project out of ten competing teams. HomeRunBingo allows anyone to play along every day of the MLB season
                                and fill out Bingo cards populated with the top Home Run hitters from across the league. When you have a player hit a Home Run, his square on your board is filled. My role in this project was figuring out a way to utilize the provided API's. I ended up using these API's to secure the previous season's homerun leaders and insert them into an array so that randomizing a userâ€™s board would
                                choose batters from the array and place them in an arbitrary spot on the bingo board. </p>
